# About Me
## My Interests
 I enjoy playing board games with my wife and friends.  Since most of the time only my wife and I are playing, I have a few 2-player games to recommend.
 * 7 Wonders: Duel
 * Splendor Duel (great for beginners)
 * Star Realms

 I have some other interests that span out from my interest in all things tech.
 1. Home Automation
 2. Home Networking (I am studying Network Management at Wake Tech)
 3. Home Theater
 4. 3D Printing

## Websites I Recommend
1. [YouTube](www.youtube.com)  
    * This is the best place for learning new things
2. [Homestarrunner](https://homestarrunner.com/main)
    * Time-travel back to the early 00's for the early days of Flash Animation (thankfully updated to HTML5)
