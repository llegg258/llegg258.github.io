# About Me
## My Interests
 I enjoy playing board games with my wife and friends.  Since most of the time only my wife and I are playing, I have a few 2-player games to recommend.
 * 7 Wonders: Duel (Build up your ancient city, increase your military might, and invest in scientific discoveries to make your civilization the best)
 * Splendor Duel (great for beginners)
 * Star Realms (A deck-building game that is easy to learn)

 I have some other interests that span out from my interest in all things tech.
 1. Home Automation (I haven't done much of this yet, but I love the idea of using technology to automate things in my life, like something as simple as turning the heat on in the morning if the temperature is below a certain amount.)
 2. Home Networking (I am studying Network Management at Wake Tech.)
 3. Home Theater (I am a movie buff, and watching a movie is an experience for me.  I want to get the experience of big sound that I can usually only get at the theater.)
 4. 3D Printing (This goes hand-in-hand with board gaming because I can print anything from additional tokens and pieces to organizing containers.)

## Websites I Recommend
1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)  
    * This is the best place for learning new things.  I am on this site nearly every day.
2. [Homestarrunner](https://homestarrunner.com/main)
    * Time-travel back to the early 00's for the early days of Flash Animation (thankfully updated to HTML5)
3. [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/)
    * **_THE_** place on the internet to go for board game reviews, asking questions of the community if you don't understand a rule, and finding games that are similar to ones you already enjoy.
